## Lead Developer
kd8lvt#5371 - the originator of ORMP and main contributor to the project. I also happen to be owner of this github repo.

## Code Wizards
Nobody... yet! Feel free to submit pull requests if you are comfortable with NodeJS and my (sometimes strange) way of coding\
Please try to keep your PR-s in-line with what my code looks like <3\
There are projects for pull requests in the Issues tab.

## Leading by Example
kd8lvt#5371 - Example Mod and Example Mod 2: Electric Boogaloo were originally test mods that just ended up being the examples. I really should get to making proper examples... 

## Think Tanks
Mantic Marksman#1749 - Came up with the RangeID system. The Documentation file was copy/pasted from their original message explaining it, and lightly edited by kd8lvt.
